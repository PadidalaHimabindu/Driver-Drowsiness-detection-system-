# Driver-Drowsiness-detection-system
Driver Drowsiness Detection System developed using Python and OpenCV. This project monitors the driver’s face and eye movements through a camera in real time. If the eyes remain closed for a few seconds, the system triggers an alert sound. It is a student project focused on improving road safety using simple and affordable technology.
